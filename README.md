# Food-Ordering-System
This is a high-performance C++ Food Ordering System designed using modern Object-Oriented Programming principles and efficient Data Structures. The application supports both manager and customer workflows, enabling real-time menu management, order placement, receipt generation, and popular item analytics. To ensure fast execution and scalability, the system leverages hash-based storage (unordered_map) for constant-time menu lookup and vectors for efficient order handling. A layered backend architecture separates data management, business logic, and user interaction, improving maintainability and extensibility. Robust input validation and safe memory handling make the system error-resistant and production-ready, while its modular design allows seamless future integration with databases, web frontends, or REST APIs. This project demonstrates practical application of DSA, OOP, and performance optimization in C++ for real-world software systems.
